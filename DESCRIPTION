Description: NAFOdown uses the bookdown package to create NAFO documents, such as
             SCRs or STACFIS reports, in Word format. The goal of this package is to
             encourage reproducible research using simple Markdown syntax and
             embedded R code, and facilitate the process of producing or updating 
             scientific documents that consistently follow NAFO formatting guidelines. 
             This package is based on Sean Anderson's csasdown and Chester Ismay's 
             thesisdown.
